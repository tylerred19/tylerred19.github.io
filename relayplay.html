        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Date:</b> April 2021 to June 2021</p>
        <p><b>Collaborators:</b> Haeun (Madison) Kim, Vanessa (Nessi) Komar, Jessie Lin, and  Lu Zhang</p>
        <p><b>Focus:</b> UX Design, Visual Design</p>
        <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma</p>

        <h1>About RelayPlay</h1>
        <p>RelayPlay is a platform that provides users with their top five personalized experiences each weekend created for them by local experts, as well as extra generalized experiences in the area.</p>

        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>We created our own <b>survey</b> to send out but we were also able to see some <b>feedback from previous user research that RelayPlay conducted</b>. Thus, these are what we found out:</p>
        <div class="relayplay-content-margin">
            <p>1. The users seemed to really appreciate the personalized experiences they were receiving</p>
            <p>2. There was a <b>lack of clarity at how to sign up for the events</b></p>
            <p>3. Users <b>aren’t able to save/look back at old experiences</b></p>
            <p>4. Some users really liked the request button while others did not use the feature</p>
            <p>5. <b>Too much information about experience coordinator</b> at top of screen</p>
            <p>6. “How to navigate your weekend” had a chunk of useful information <b>but users weren’t reading it</b></p>
        </div>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>    
        <h3><b>How might we design a mobile/home page that’s more informative and user friendly?</b></h3>

        <h1>User Personas</h1>


        <h1 style="color: red">Not done yet, below is my old stuff</h1>

        <h1>Personas</h1>
        <div class="persona-two-columns">
            <div>
                <h2 style="color: red">Persona 1: Helen</h2>
                <p>Age: 28</p>
                <p>A software engineer working remotely at home</p>
                <p>She wants to have her pizza quickly, so that she can pick up the pizza from the store that is close to her house. Also, she prefers carside carryout to reduce contact in the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Sometimes she has to wait for a bit too long, that she might get anxious when she still has a lot of tasks to do for her job.</p>

                <p>Age: 23</p>
                <p>An employee working at a pizza restaurant</p>
                <p>Adam does not want his customers to wait for a long line to carry out their pizza.</p>
                <p>However, he notices that many times customers have to wait in a long line, and they get frustrated. Especially when some people feel uncomfortable that they have to wear a mask.</p>

        </table>
        
        <p>For Domino’s Pizza mobile application, <b>there is no feature that can recognize customers who are ready to pick up</b>. Thus, this gives frustration to both customers and employees. Since there are many users tapping the new feature at the same time, employees have to spend more time to recognize the identity of users. Because of that, users have to wait for an extra time before picking up their pizza. Additionally, <b>it might be safer if the time of interacting between customers and employees is reduced.</b></p>

        <h1>UI Sketches</h1>

        <div class="two-sketches">
            <div>
                <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
                <p>The first sketch offers a new feature which helps customers to save more time and employees to identify customers easier. Instead of directly asking customer’s or vehicle’s information, this flow allows employees to have enough information to know who is in front of the door and what their order is. For users, this flow reduces contacting with other people under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health.</p>
                <img src="images/sketch-1.png" alt="sketch-1">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
                <p>Similar to the first sketch, the second one also reduces contacting with other people under the pandemic, which is very important for user’s health, by having enough information before giving the food instead of directly asking customers. However, there are a few differences in the process. Instead of showing codes in the first one, users can enter their information about themselves, including their appearance for picking up in person. While the process for “In Car” has the same UX flow, it is actually a little bit different about details in Sketches section.</p>
                <img src="images/sketch-2.png" alt="sketch-2">

        </div>

        <h1>Low Fidelity Prototypes</h1>

        <div class="two-sketches">
            <div>
                <h3>Prototype 1</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">For this prototype, it has two options to pick up, which are “In Person” and “Contactless” (or “In Car”). For “In Person”, it has a number on the app that helps employees recognize which food they should give to the particular customer. When customers arrive, they can show their numbers in front of the restaurant to let employees know. For “Contactless”, it has one dropdown option to choose for the type of vehicle (motorcycle, sedan, suv, truck, etc.), and one input field for license plate number. With that information of the vehicle, it helps employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to quickly give the food to them.</p>
                <img src="images/lo-fi-1.png" alt="lo-fi-1">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, Prototype 2 also has the same two options to pick up. However, there are a few differences in details of what information customers can provide to help employees. For “In Person”, it asks for the description of customers’ appearance, including “Gender/Race”, “Shirt Color”, and “Pant Color”. Thus, employees can recognize different customers more easily with different details about each customer. For “In Car”, it asks for the “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”. Similar to Prototype 1, “In Car” option helps employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to quickly give the food to them.</p>
                <img src="images/lo-fi-2.png" alt="lo-fi-2">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Low Fidelity User Testing</h1>

        <p>What users liked most about <b>Prototype 1</b> was it was more simple in “In Person” option, since it only showed the number to confirm with the employees. While, what they liked most about <b>Prototype 2</b> was they did not have to type license plate numbers, which many people did not remember them, and had to go out of the vehicle and check for the numbers.</p>

        <p>For <b>Prototype 1</b>, the only confusion was the confirmation number of the “In Person” option, since it was not descriptive enough in order to guide customers what to do with it. While, there was no struggling or confusion when they used <b>Prototype 2</b>.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, they preferred to use <b>Prototype 1</b>, since it was more simple to use, and had less details to fill out.</p>

        <p>For the “In Person” option, they preferred <b>Prototype 1</b>, because they did not like to fill out details about their appearance. Additionally, they mentioned that asking about “Gender/Race” might be sensitive to many people, which may lead to uncomfortable situations.</p>

        <p>For the “In Car” option, they did not prefer either prototype. Nevertheless, one of the participants suggested <b>having mix options from both prototypes for the “In Car” option including “Type of Vehicle”, “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”.</b></p>

        <h1>High Fidelity Prototype</h1>

        <p>The high-fidelity prototype actually <b>implements the mix of both of our original UX Flows</b>, since we got feedback from the users that they prefer some features of the first flow, while they also prefer some features of the second flow. Therefore, we did not have to change our flow technically, even though it took a bit to select the features from both flows to combine into one high fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h1>What we learned from the iteration?</h1>

        <p>• We learned that it was really good to have feedback from users, that we could learn more from different perspectives.</p>
        <p>• We also realized that sometimes there were details that we did not recognize during our design process, and the users actually helped us a lot in spotting the details that we needed to improve for our design.</p>

        <h1>Before-and-After Stories</h1>     
        <p>After feedback, we decided to use the alternative screen for “Vehicle Carryout”. For the original screen, when users typed information in “Make / Model / Brand”, the word “Make / Model / Brand” would disappear. If users forgot what information they needed to type in, they had to delete everything and started over again. Therefore, putting the word “Make / Model / Brand” above the text input field instead of putting it inside would help users be able to avoid that situation.</p>
        <img src="images/before-and-after.png" alt="before-and-after">

        <h1>Next Steps</h1>
        <p>If we were to continue this project, we would like to have more interviews with people who eat pizzas, in order to gather more insights. From that, we would be able to look at, and see which aspects that we could improve further.</p>

        <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
        <p>It was pretty interesting that my teammate and I learned how to address when things did not go as planned. It actually helped us improve problem-solving skills, and how to communicate with other people effectively when going through challenges.</p>
