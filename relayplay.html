        <h1>RELAYPLAY COMING SOON! :)</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: -30px;">Note: If you would like to skip to our final prototype, you can go to <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/LGB8qV78lHoo9lZIRQY6aG/RelayPlay-Copy?page-id=138%3A32&node-id=639%3A904&viewport=242%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=639%3A904&show-proto-sidebar=1" class="relayplay-link"><b>HERE</b></a>.</p>

        <h1>What is RelayPlay?</h1>
        <p>RelayPlay is a platform that provides users with their top five personalized experiences each weekend created for them by local experts, as well as extra generalized experiences in the area.</p>

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Date:</b> April 2021 to June 2021</p>
        <p><b>Collaborators:</b> Haeun (Madison) Kim, Vanessa (Nessi) Komar, Jessie Lin, and  Lu Zhang</p>
        <p><b>Focus:</b> UX/UI Design, Visual Design</p>
        <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma</p>

        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>We <b>created our own survey</b> to send out but we were also able to see some <b>feedback from previous user research that RelayPlay conducted</b>. Thus, these are what we found out:</p>
        <div class="relayplay-content-margin">
            <p>1. The users seemed to really appreciate the personalized experiences they were receiving</p>
            <p>2. There was a <b>lack of clarity at how to sign up for the events</b></p>
            <p>3. Users <b>aren’t able to save/look back at old experiences</b></p>
            <p>4. Some users really liked the request button while others did not use the feature</p>
            <p>5. <b>Too much information about experience coordinator</b> at top of screen</p>
            <p>6. “How to navigate your weekend” had a chunk of useful information <b>but users weren’t reading it</b></p>
        </div>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>    
        <h3><b>How might we design a mobile/home page that’s more informative and user friendly?</b></h3>

        <h1>Initial Wireframes</h1>

        <p>In order to have different possibilities for layouts, each member of our team created the wireframes separately.</p>

        <h3>My Wireframes</h3>
        <h3 style="color: red">ADD SOME EXPLANATION DIRECTLY TO THE WIREFRAMES LATER</h3>

        <h3>Other Wireframes</h3>

        <h1>Final Wireframes</h1>

        <h3 style="color: red">NEED TO DESCRIBE FEATURES LATER</h3>

        <p>After creating the screens independently, we discussed with each other to see the best layouts that we had. Then, we combined the features that we had as you can see the final wireframes below.</p>

        <div class="relayplay-three-columns">
            <img src="images/relayplay-final-frame-1.png" alt="competitive-audit">

        <div style="margin-top: 5%;"></div>

        <div class="relayplay-three-columns">

        </div>

        <h1>Hi-Fi Mockups (Initial)</h1>
        <p>With the branding colors and pictures from the website, we built on our hi-fi prototype after the wireframes. The following are some adjustments that we made:</p>
        <div class="relayplay-content-margin">
            <p>1. Added images that correlates to the provided event</p>
            <p>2. Being consistent with branding colors</p>
            <p>3. Elaborated on certain features</p>
            <p>4. Added more features to improve efficiency</p>
            <p>5. Removed some unnecessary features</p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="color: red">Not done yet</h1>
