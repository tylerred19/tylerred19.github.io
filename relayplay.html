        <p class="small-header">WHAT IS RELAYPLAY?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>RelayPlay is a platform that provides users with their top five personalized experiences each weekend created for them by local experts, as well as extra generalized experiences in the area.</p>

        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <p class="small-header">PROJECT OVERVIEW</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Date:</b> April 2021 to June 2021</p>
        <p><b>Collaborators:</b> Haeun (Madison) Kim, Vanessa (Nessi) Komar, Jessie Lin, and  Lu Zhang</p>
        <p><b>Focus:</b> UX/UI Design, Visual Design</p>
        <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma</p>

        <!-- User Research -->
        <p class="small-header">USER RESEARCH</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We <b>created our own survey</b> to send out but we were also able to see some <b>feedback from previous user research that RelayPlay conducted</b>. Thus, these are what we found out:</p>
        <div class="relayplay-content-margin">
            <p>1. The users seemed to really appreciate the personalized experiences they were receiving</p>
            <p>2. There was a <b>lack of clarity at how to sign up for the events</b></p>
            <p>3. Users <b>aren’t able to save/look back at old experiences</b></p>
            <p>4. Some users really liked the request button while others did not use the feature</p>
            <p>5. <b>Too much information about experience coordinator</b> at top of screen</p>
            <p>6. “How to navigate your weekend” had a chunk of useful information <b>but users weren’t reading it</b></p>

        <p>With the branding colors and pictures from the website, we built on our hi-fi prototype after the wireframes. The following are some adjustments that we made:</p>
        <div class="relayplay-content-margin">
            <p>1. Added images that correlates to the provided event</p>
            <p>2. Being consistent with branding colors</p>
            <p>3. Elaborated on certain features</p>
            <p>4. Added more features to improve efficiency</p>
            <p>5. Removed some unnecessary features</p>
