            <p class="tymex-header">Project Overview</p>
            <p><b>Role:</b> UX Writing Intern</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma, Figjam, Confluence</p>
            <p><b>Duration:</b> 4 months (Nov 2023 - Mar 2024)</p>
            <p><b>Team:</b> UX Writers, Product Designers</p>

            <!-- What I did -->
            <br>
            <p>During a 4-month period as a UX Writing Intern at TymeX, I worked alongside UX Writers and Product Designers on a variety of tasks, including...</p>

            <p class="tymex-header">Content Audit</p>
            <!-- <p>With the guidance of the Senior UX Writer, I conducted an audit for more than 15 features of GoTyme Bank. During the audit, I took a look at the content (and some degree of design) of error messages, success states, and buttons. From that, I was able to spot inconsistencies, and also filter reusbale elements to separate tables.</p> -->
            <p>Led by the Senior UX Writer, I conducted a comprehensive audit of over 15 GoTyme Bank's app features. This involved evaluating error messages, success states, and button copies, along with relevant design elements. My analysis identified inconsistencies and enabled the creation of reusable components, improving overall design efficiency.</p>

            <p class="tymex-header">UX Copywriting</p>
            <p>I was also working on writing short copies for some parts of the GoRewards Points. To create most impactful short copies for the feature, I drafted several variations and sought feedback from the Senior UX Writer. This iterative process helped me improve the copies' effectiveness.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>GoRewards Points < 1 (Initial Version: Points = 0)</h4>
            <img src="images/tymex/1st-points-0.png" style="margin-top: 2vw ; margin-bottom: 2vw">
            <img src="images/tymex/2nd-points-0.png" style="margin-top: 2vw ; margin-bottom: 2vw">
            <img src="images/tymex/final-points-1.png" style="margin-top: 2vw ; margin-bottom: 2vw">

            <br>
            <h4>Pay and Earn (More Descriptive)</h4>
            <img src="images/tymex/pay-and-earn.png" style="margin-top: 2vw ; margin-bottom: 2vw">

            <br>
            <h4>Error Message - Points Deducted</h4>

            <br>
            <h4>Error Message - Insufficient Points</h4>
            <img src="images/tymex/error-screens-3.png" style="margin-top: 2vw; margin-bottom: 2vw;">

            <p class="tymex-header">Localization / Translation</p>
            <p>Localization was also a part of UX Writing. It was not simply about translating from English to Vietnamese, but also knowing how Vietnamese users can intuitively understand and navigate through the application. Thus, besides the translation, I also conducted some research on how Vietnamese terms can be different from English ones, as many cases were not possible to translate directly.</p>
            <p>The following are some of the examples of the localization.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Cash Deposit and Withdrawal</h4>

            <p class="tymex-header">Capstone Research</p>
            <p>Besides the tasks that I mentioned above, I also conducted research for my UX Writing Internship Capstone, with the guidance of the Senior UX Writer. The purposes of the Capstone were studying the languages used in the core feature labels of Vietnam's top consumer banking apps, and identifying UX Writing considerations for later stages.</p>

                <p>&#x25FC; Conducted research on which banking apps in Vietnam are on top with three criteria such as financial capability, media reputation, and survey results. </p>
                <p>&#x25FC; Analyzed the information architecture (IA) of top Vietnamese banking apps, focusing on their use of labels.</p>
                <p>&#x25FC; Analyzed the terminology used by the leading banking apps to identify any differences with GoTyme Bank.</p>

            <p class="tymex-header">Learnings</p>
            <p>Even though I had explored User Experience for a while, there were still many interesting aspects to learn, especially giving the fact that UX Writing was pretty new to me. From this opportunity, I learned that:</p>
            <div class="content-margin">
                <p>&#x25FC; There was a lot of UX Research in UX Writing, since we needed to understand how different terms influence user interactions.</p>

            <p>This internship was my first opportunity to work in a fast-paced large corporation, so there were a lot more meetings and collaborations than the experiences that I had before. The experience </p>
