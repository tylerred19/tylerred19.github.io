        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>Note: the project is still in work progress. Thus, it is not completed yet, and there will be updates later.</p>
        <p>Project Duration: TBD (starting from 06/26/20)</p>
        <p>Team: Nhut Nguyen, and Tam (Tyler) Tran (me)</p>
        <p>Role: UI/UX Designer, Front-End Developer</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since websites are growing rapidly nowadays, my friend and I have an idea, which is making a website for his family's restaurant. It will help the people have more information about the restaurant when they look up online. Therefore, we are going through steps to proceed.</p>
        <h2>Meet Nicole! (User Persona)</h2>
        <img style="width: 40%" src="images/nh-001.png">
        <p>Nicole is a person who loves good food, and going out to eat. She would like to have more information about the restaurant (menu, available time, etc.), before she goes there and eats. However, there is no information that she can look up online. So, it makes her uncertain about whether which food she wants to eat, or what time she can come to the restaurant.</p>
        <h2>Problem and Solution</h2>
        <p>There is no information about the restaurant online that people can check to make sure they would like to go there. Thus, one way to solve it is making a website that has enough information about the restaurant, and making sure that it is accessible for the users.</p>
        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
        <img style="width: 100px; margin-left: 0;" src="images/nnt-logo.png">
        <p>Note: We only show our draft version of the logo design, in order to avoid some people getting the ideas from our final version.</p>
        <h2>High Fidelity Prototyping</h2>

        <p>Note: This is just a draft of the prototype for now. I might update later also. :)</p>
