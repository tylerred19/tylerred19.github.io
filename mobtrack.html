        <h1>Project Overview</h1
        <p>For our Interaction Design class, we tackled the issue of "The Quantified Self" aspect, by addressing the problem of not being able to reflect daily patterns. When life gets busy, especially when being overwhelmed with responsibilities (e.g. family, school, work, etc.), many people feel lost. While, they do not know how what to do.</p>
        <p>From the issue, we were motivated to create our mobile app, MobTrack. This was an app that allows users to add their daily activities, and check their activity reports and suggestions from the information that is gathered from those activities. From that, they are able to keep track of their daily patterns, and reflect on the meaning that animates them.</p>
        <p><b>Date: </b>January 2021 - March 2021</p>
        <p><b>Role: </b>Product Manager, UX/UI Developer</p>
        <b>Teammates:</b>
        <p>UX/UI Designer: An Huynh</p>
        <p>Full Stack Developer: Jiachen Niu</p>
        <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, GitHub, and Heroku</p>
        <h1>Research Methods</h1>
        <p>We chose <b>interviews</b> as the research method. The reason we chose this particular method was because we would like to talk in depth with users, and have open ended questions. Therefore, we would have more qualitative information, and there would be more to analyze. Additionally, the participants would like to talk with us using Zoom. For our plan, we were going to interview about 5 to 7 participants for our project. Moreover, they were relevant to our project because they have or would like to find a way or more to <b>reflect their life.</b></p>
        <h1>Research Findings</h1>
        <!-- <p>&#8226; Most participants took a lot of time and effort to reflect on specific aspects.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>&#8226; One participant mentioned that he could not find a way to have suggestions about his life.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>&#8226; Some participants wrote down their activities on their notes (either on phone or notebook), but the notes were cluttered.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Some of them reflecting on the events that they remember, but they thought they could remember those events not correctly.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>&#8226; Most participants pointed that being too busy with responsibilities was one of the factor causing.</p> -->
        <p>&#8226; It was common to feel lost, and did not know what to do in life.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Most participants would like to find a way to reflect on their life, but they were not really able to it.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Most of them pointed that being too busy with responsibilities was one of the reasons that they did not really reflect on their life.</p>
        <p>&#8226; Being unmotivated after some challenges in life was another factor for many of them.</p>
        <p>&#8226; A few participants reflect on their life through their notes, which either on notebook or phone. Nonetheless, it could be not effective due to not being able to organize or filter the notes.</p>
        <p style="color: red"><b>Note: Need to check the research findings later</b></p>
        <h1>Point of View</h1>
        <p>According to our research, we got our Point of View for this aspect which is:</p>
        <p><b>“When people get busy, they can forget about what makes their lives meaningful. Prompting people with their daily patterns can help them reflect on the meaning that animates them.”</b></p>
        <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
        <p>Our team created a few storyboards, in order to illustrate the issues relating to our topic, and how to solve them. The storyboard shown below was one of them.</p>

        </div>
        <h1>Paper Prototyping</h1>
        <p>After sketching out the stories, we made two paper prototypes to visualize the main components of our mobile app. In order to find where we would be able to improve before moving on to designing a high fidelity prototype, we conducted three user testing on the paper prototypes.</p>
        <h3>Prototype 1</h3>
        <p>Prototype 1 focused on adding activities to the app, with information about Activity Name, Type, Starting Time, and Stopping Time. From those recorded activities, users would be able to check weekly report with suggestions from the app.</p>
        <p style="color: red"><b>Write Prototype 1 focus on blah blah blah later</b></p>
        <img src="images/mobtrack-prototype-1-1.png" class="storyboard-img">
        <img src="images/mobtrack-prototype-1-2.png" class="storyboard-img">
        <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
        <p style="color: red"><b>Write Prototype 2 focus on blah blah blah later</b></p>
        <p>Prototype 2 focused on a different way to address, which was seeking advice from other people in a communitity. Also, users would be able to give advice to other people.</p>
        <img src="images/mobtrack-prototype-2.jpg" class="storyboard-img">
        <h1>User Feedback</h1>
        <p>We conducted user testing on Zoom, and got some feedback. Based on the feedback from the evaluators, we found 4 major issues with our paper prototypes such as:</p>
        <div class="mobtrack-content-margin">
            <p><b>&#8226; Not having help and documentation</b></p>
            <p> Two users criticized that some sections of both prototypes were confusing, and having the “Help” section would help improve the “Help and Documentation” aspect.</p>
            <p><b>&#8226; Lack of aesthetic and minimalist design</b></p>
            <p>One user told us that both prototypes were really text heavy. Thus, adding more visuals would improve this aspect for the next steps.</p>
            <p><b>&#8226; Lack of error prevention</b></p>
            <p>There were not enough pages or pop-ups for confirmation to make sure that users did not take action accidentally.</p>
            <p style="color: red"><b>Need to add more and adjust this later</b></p>
