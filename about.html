            <h2>Hi!!! &#9787;</h2>
            <p>I am Tam Tran (Tyler), who is a student at UC San Diego majoring in Design and Interaction (HCI). I love my major, because it is where I can use both analytical and creative aspects of me. My goal is to become a Front End Developer, UI/UX Designer, or UI/UX Engineer. So, I can use my skills to contribute, and make more accessible, enjoyable, and fun design and/or websites for users.</p>
            <p>I am looking for any opportunities including internships and projects, especially for Fall 2020, and Summer 2021. So, I can contribute and learn more.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a product designer doing a side project for ACM UC San Diego, that my team is building a voting software. The project helps me a lot in learning how to design wireframes, make visual design guideline, and have user testing.</p>
            <p>Previously, I am a product design intern at RISE during summer, where my team designs and develops an online learning platform. I learned a lot from this project, which includes communicating with other members, design interfaces, and organizing tasks.</p>
            <h2>In my free time</h2>
            <p>I love self-learning (especially design + development), going to beaches, basketball, video games, sci-fi movies and shows, pop-punk music, making memes, and photography.</p>
            <h2>Please feel free to contact me, and connect with me. Thank you and have a good day!</h2>
