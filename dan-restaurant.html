    <div class="ui-margin">
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>Note: the project is still in work progress. Thus, it is not completed yet, and there will be updates later.</p>
        <p>Project Duration: TBD</p>
        <p>Team: Nhut Nguyen, and Tam Tran (me)</p>
        <p>Role: UI/UX Designer, Front-End Developer</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Since websites are growing rapidly nowadays, my friend and I have an idea, which is making a website for his family's restaurant. It will help the people have more information about the restaurant when they look up online. Therefore, we are going through steps to proceed.</p>
        <h2>Meet Nick! (User Persona)</h2>
        <p>Nick is a person who loves good food, and going out to eat. He would like to have more information about the restaurant (menu, available time, etc.), before he goes there and eats. However, there is no information that he can look up online. So, it makes him uncertain about whether which food he wants to eat, or what time he can come to the restaurant.</p>
        <h2>Tentative Process</h2>
        <p>Problem and Solution</p>
