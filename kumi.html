        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>During the pandemic, there is a transition to online learning. While many schools are able to adapt the situation by affording specific online platforms such as Blackboard or Canvas, a lot of lower-income schools have been <b>struggling due to not being able to afford an online platform for students</b>. One way to address this aspect, which is done by many schools, is using emails, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and so on. Nevertheless, it leads to other issues, including <b>not being personalized to a school, technical problems, and other online challenges</b>. Additionally, a lot of existing online learning platforms are <b>not intuitive or difficult to use.</b></p>

        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Currently, lower-income schools, including The Seeds School, have been using a lot of online platforms for online education. <b>Not having a personalized and interactive platform during the pandemic can lead to a frustrating, overwhelming, and disconnected learning experience for students.</b></p>
        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>To address the issues mentioned above, a couple of students decided to build Kumi, <b>a low-cost, innovative, and intuitive Learning Management System (LMS)</b> for lower-income schools.</p>
        <h1>How Might We Statement</h1>
        <p>How might we provide a smooth process of connecting to information about learning materials for students?</p>
        <h1>User Research and Insights</h1>
        <p>To have a better understanding about Learning Management System (LMS), we carefully considered the limitations of existing online learning platforms. After reviewing the platforms, we identified the issues, and put them into several points.</p>
        <p>Then, in order to really understand how high school students find essential information about learning materials, we discussed with real high school students. So, these are what we found out:</p>
        <div class="kumi-content-margin">
            <p>1. Students need to be guided in learning</p>
            <p>2. Students need to be reminded about what to do</p>
            <p>3. Finding information online can be frustrating</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Product Goals</h1>
        <p><b>1. Personalization:</b> Allow users to personalize the platform, including dashboard, classes, and calendar. So, they can utilize the platform as a personal learning tool for themselves.</p>
        <p><b>2. Visual Clarity:</b> Provide intuitive visual signifiers to help users going through learning process more easily, and effectively.</p>
        <p><b>3. Minimalistic Content:</b> Avoid unnecessary details, and only show essential content to help users staying away from cognitive overload, and feeling overwhelmed.</p>
        <p><b>4. Google Calendar Integration:</b> Allow users to directly see their schedule with their tasks and deadlines. Therefore, they are able to plan their schedules more efficiently.</p>
        <h1>Design Iterations</h1>
        <p style="color: red"><b>Note: The project is current in update, so it will be on a template for the iterations. :)</b></p>
