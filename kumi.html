        <hr>
        <p>During the pandemic, there is a transition to online learning. While many schools are able to adapt the situation by affording specific online platforms such as Blackboard or Canvas, a lot of lower-income schools have been <b>struggling due to not being able to afford an online platform for students</b>. One way to address this aspect, which is done by many schools, is using emails, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and so on. Nevertheless, it leads to other issues, including <b>not being personalized to a school, technical problems, and other online challenges</b>. Additionally, a lot of existing online learning platforms are <b>not intuitive or difficult to use.</b></p>

                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p>Currently, lower-income schools, including The Seeds School, have been using a lot of online platforms for online education. <b>Not having a personalized and interactive platform during the pandemic can lead to a frustrating, overwhelming, and disconnected learning experience for students.</b></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>The Solution</h1>
                <p>To address the issues mentioned above, a couple of students decided to build a platform called Kumi, which was <b>a low-cost, innovative, and intuitive Learning Management System (LMS)</b> for lower-income schools.</p>

        <!-- User Research and Insights -->
        <p class="small-header">USER RESEARCH AND INSIGHTS</p>
        <hr>
        <p>To have a better understanding about Learning Management System (LMS), we carefully considered the limitations of existing online learning platforms. After reviewing the platforms, we identified the issues, and put them into several points.</p>
        <p>Then, in order to really understand how high school students find essential information about learning materials, we discussed with real high school students. So, these are what we found out:</p>
        <div class="kumi-content-margin">
            <p>1. Students need to be guided in learning</p>
            <p>2. Students need to be reminded about what to do</p>
            <p>3. Finding information online can be frustrating</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Product Goals -->
        <p class="small-header">PRODUCT GOALS</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>1. Personalization:</b> Allow users to personalize the platform, including dashboard, classes, and calendar. So, they can utilize the platform as a personal learning tool for themselves.</p>
        <p><b>2. Visual Clarity:</b> Provide intuitive visual signifiers to help users going through learning process more easily, and effectively.</p>
        <p><b>3. Minimalistic Content:</b> Avoid unnecessary details, and only show essential content to help users staying away from cognitive overload, and feeling overwhelmed.</p>
        <p><b>4. Google Calendar Integration:</b> Allow users to directly see their schedule with their tasks and deadlines. Therefore, they are able to plan their schedules more efficiently.</p>

        <!-- Design Iterations -->
        <p class="small-header">DESIGN ITERATIONS</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Login Page</h3>
        <p>After discussing with team members, we made changes to the login page, such as making the font size and input fields smaller. Thus, it would fit better to the desktop screen.</p>
        <div class="kumi-two-columns">
            <div>
                <img src="images/kumi-login-before.png" alt="login-before">
                <h4>Before</h4>

                <img src="images/kumi-login-after.png" alt="login-after">
                <h4>After</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Dashboard</h3>
        <p>For the dashboard, we organized content to three sections, such as "Announcements", "Updates", and "To-do List". Then, we adjusted the design, by focusing on "Notifications" section. Additionally, we added "Calendar" and "Upcoming Deadlines" on the right in order to help students navigate the content more easily.</p>
        <div class="kumi-two-columns">
            <div>
                <img src="images/kumi-dashboard-before.png" alt="dashboard-before">

                <h4>After</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Course Navigation</h3>
        <p>Based on the feedback from other team members. We reduced the size of the course cards, and only showed important information to increase aesthetic and minimalist design. While, we added the "..." at the bottom right of each card in order to give users more options to choose.</p>
        <div class="kumi-two-columns">
            <div>
                <img src="images/kumi-course-before.png" alt="course-before">

                <h4>After</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Class Information</h3>
        <p>We realized that students can see their assignment submission in "Assignments" section, so we removed "Submission" section to avoid unnecessary elements for the platform. Additionally, at the bottom right, we combined "Links" and "Tools" sections into "Class Info" in order to save some space.</p>
        <div class="kumi-two-columns">

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Additional Pages</h3>
        <p>We did not have enough time to go through iterations for the rest. So, for the pages shown below, we collaborated to make a design for those only once before the showcase.</p>
        <div class="kumi-two-columns">
            <div>
                <img src="images/kumi-assignments.png" alt="assignments">

        <p>If we were to continue this project, we would go through iterations for the additional pages above. We would also design pages that are exclusively for teachers and admins.</p>

        <!-- What I Learned -->
        <p class="small-header">WHAT I LEARNED</p>
        <hr>
        <p>1. Prioritize more time to organize tasks, and focus on essential tasks first</p>
        <p>2. Discuss with other team members more about the main goals before working on the design</p>
        <p>3. Spend more time on reiterating specific features based on suggestions from other members of the team</p>

        <!-- Final Reflection -->
        <p class="small-header">FINAL REFLECTION</p>
        <hr>
        <p>It was wonderful working with other team members. I was amazed by how insightful and creative each person contributed ideas into the design, discussions, and iterations. On the other hand, since the project had time limit, we would need to prioritize which pages or features were the most important to work on.</p>
