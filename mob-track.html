        <h1>Project Overview</h1
        <p>For our Interaction Design class, we tackled the issue of "The Quantified Self" aspect, by addressing the problem of not being able to reflect daily patterns. When life gets busy, especially when being overwhelmed with responsibilities (e.g. family, school, work, etc.), many people feel lost. While, they do not know how what to do.</p>
        <p>From the issue, we were motivated to create our mobile app, MobTrack. This was an app that allows users to add their daily activities, and check their activity reports and suggestions from the information that is gathered from those activities. From that, they are able to keep track of their daily patterns, and reflect on the meaning that animates them.</p>

        <h1>Needfinding</h1>
        <p>I asked a few friends if I was allowed to observe them when they tried to manage their schedule, when they reflected their life, and/or when they considered their life goals. During the observation, I took notes on their behaviors.</p>
        <h3>Notes/Observations:</h3>

        <p>“When we get busy, we can forget about what makes our lives meaningful. Prompting people with their daily patterns can help them reflect on the meaning that animates them.”</p>
