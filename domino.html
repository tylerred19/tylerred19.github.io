    <h1 class="domino-title">Domino's Pizza App Redesign</h1>

    <div class="ui-margin">
        <p>Note: The project is still in work progress. Thus, it is not completed yet, and there will be updates later.</p>
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>Time: September 2020 to Present</p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>UI/UX Designers: An Huynh, and Tam (Tyler) Tran (me)</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We are planning to extend or redesign Domino’s Pizza app. For users, we are targeting people who prefer ordering to pick their pizza up. Our current goal is to have users spend less time on waiting to pick up their food, and reduce contacting with employees. Therefore, that would be safer and more convenient, especially during COVID-19. It is really important to keep people safe during the pandemic, and also help people feel more comfortable with using the app, that people do not have to worry about having to order in person, or through phone calls, which employees might be too busy and do not pick up the phone calls sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        <p>Our main research goal is to have a better understanding of users’ perspectives, especially everyone has a different point of view. As designers, we know that if we do not have proper user research, we might have our design plan with biased perspectives, that has happened a lot in many designs around the world. We chose interviews as a research method. The reason we chose this particular method was because we would like to talk in depth with users, and have open ended questions. Therefore, we would have more qualitative information, and there would be more to analyze. Also, our users would like to talk with us by calling through phones, or using Zoom. For our plan, we are going to interview about 5 to 7 people for our project. Additionally, the participants are relevant to our project because they often eat pizza, and would like to use an app to save their time, and be safer during the pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Research Findings (Need to adjust this later)</h2>
        <p>Most people we interviewed including domino’s employee said that customers have to wait longer than their ideal time in the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Even though they feel okay most of the time, they would like to have less waiting time. Moreover, some people might get irritated sometimes, if they are starving.</p>
        <p>The average of customer’s waiting time is around 1’ ~> 3’ (normal condition, no social distance) and the average of customer’s ideal time is around 5’ ~> 10’ in pandemic. The actual waiting time is around 20’ ~> 25’ at peak hour and weekend. On Sunday, some participants had to wait more than 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>The employee also pointed out that they sometimes don’t have enough space for cooked-pizzas (keep warm before pick-up) because of stacked orders. (Our new feature also solve this problem)</p>
        <h3>Note: There are new findings in Milestone 5 to add later</h3>

        <h2>Problem Statement (Need to reconsider)</h2>
        <p>People who prefer to pick up their pizzas usually have to wait longer than their ideal time, and they might get frustrated if they wait too long, or they are starving. Even though there is a feature to help customers notify employees that they have arrived, there are still uncomfortable experiences from both perspectives. The reason is there is no way to confirm customers’ identity early, and the only way to confirm is to directly ask them.</p>

        <h2>How Might We Statements (might reduce the amount of statements)</h2>
        <p>How might we help customers spend less time on waiting to save their time?</p>
        <p>How might we help customers reduce the time wearing masks?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees have an easier time noticing when customers come to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees reduce losing their customers because they have to wait for their pizza for a long time? (might adjust this later)</p>
        <p>How might we help employees recognize customers who have arrived and ready to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees not feel frustrated because there are too many customers tapping the “I’m Here” button at the same time?</p>

        <h2>Personas (Need to check the details of the personas)</h2>
        <div class="persona-two-columns">
            <div>
                <h2>Persona 1: Helen</h2>
                <p>A software engineer working remotely at home</p>
                <p>She wants to have her pizza quickly, so that she can pick up the pizza from the store that is close to her house. Also, she prefers carside carryout to reduce contact in the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Sometimes she has to wait for a bit too long, that she might get anxious when she still has a lot of tasks to do for her job.</p>

                <img src="images/persona-1.png" alt="persona-1" class="persona-pic">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="persona-two-columns-2">
            <div>
                <img src="images/persona-2.png" alt="persona-2" class="persona-pic">
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Persona 2: Adam</h2>
                <p>An employee working at a pizza restaurant</p>
                <p>Adam does not want his customers to wait for a long line to carry out their pizza.</p>
                <p>However, many times customers have to wait in a long line, and they get frustrated. Especially when some people feel uncomfortable that they have to wear a mask.</p>
                <p>He also notices that many users use Domino’s new “ByPass” feature and click “I’m here” to confirm at the same time, which confuses employees.</p>
