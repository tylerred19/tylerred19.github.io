        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>Time: September 2020 to December 2020</p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>UI/UX Designers: An Huynh, and Tam (Tyler) Tran (me)</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We are planning to extend or redesign Domino’s Pizza app. For users, we are targeting people who prefer ordering to pick their pizza up. Our current goal is to have users spend less time on waiting to pick up their food, and reduce contacting with employees. Therefore, that would be safer and more convenient, especially during COVID-19. It is really important to keep people safe during the pandemic, and also help people feel more comfortable with using the app, that people do not have to worry about having to order in person, or through phone calls, which employees might be too busy and do not pick up the phone calls sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        <p>Our main research goal is to have a better understanding of users’ perspectives, especially everyone has a different point of view. As designers, we know that if we do not have proper user research, we might have our design plan with biased perspectives, that has happened a lot in many designs around the world. We chose interviews as a research method. The reason we chose this particular method was because we would like to talk in depth with users, and have open ended questions. Therefore, we would have more qualitative information, and there would be more to analyze. Also, our users would like to talk with us by calling through phones, or using Zoom. For our plan, we are going to interview about 5 to 7 people for our project. Additionally, the participants are relevant to our project because they often eat pizza, and would like to use an app to save their time, and be safer during the pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>1. Most people we interviewed including domino’s employee said that customers have to wait longer than their ideal time in the pandemic.</p>
        <p>2. Even though they feel okay most of the time, they would like to have less waiting time. Moreover, some people might get irritated sometimes, if they are starving.</p>
        <p>3. The employee also pointed out that they sometimes don’t have enough space for cooked-pizzas (keep warm before pick-up) because of stacked orders. (Our new feature also solves this problem)</p>
        <p>4. Most participants are okay with directly talking to employees, because they wear their mask. However, they prefer to reduce contact with employees as much as possible in order to be safer.</p>
        <p>5. Additionally, a few participants mention that it would be great to reduce the time wearing a mask, since they are not comfortable with wearing it. Therefore, they prefer the “in car” option for picking up their food. With the “in car” option, they can stay in their car and do not have to wear a mask unless it is necessary. Also, they do not have to stand outside, especially if there are many other people also waiting for their food.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>People who prefer to pick up their pizzas usually have to wait longer than their ideal time, and they might get frustrated if they wait too long, or they are starving. Even though there is a feature to help customers notify employees that they have arrived, there are still uncomfortable experiences from both perspectives. The reason is there is no way to confirm customers’ identity early, and the only way to confirm is to directly ask them.</p>

        <h2>How Might We Statements</h2>
        <p>How might we help customers spend less time on waiting to save their time?</p>
        <p>How might we help customers reduce the time wearing masks?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees have an easier time noticing when customers come to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees reduce losing their customers because they have to wait for their pizza for a long time? (might adjust this later)</p>
        <p>How might we help employees recognize customers who have arrived and ready to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees not feel frustrated because there are too many customers tapping the “I’m Here” button at the same time?</p>

                <p>She wants to have her pizza quickly, so that she can pick up the pizza from the store that is close to her house. Also, she prefers carside carryout to reduce contact in the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Sometimes she has to wait for a bit too long, that she might get anxious when she still has a lot of tasks to do for her job.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>For Domino’s Pizza mobile application, there is no feature that can recognize customers who are ready to pick up. Thus, this gives frustration to both customers and employees. Since there are many users tapping the new feature at the same time, employees have to spend more time to recognize the identity of users. Because of that, users have to wait for an extra time before picking up their pizza. Additionally, it might be safer if the time of interacting between customers and employees is reduced.</p>

        <h2>UI Sketches</h2>

        <div class="two-sketches">
            <div>
                <img src="images/sketch-1.png" alt="sketch-1">
                <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">User Flow 1 is designed for both Adam and Helen personas because it offers a new feature which helps customers to save more time and employees to identify customers easier. Instead of directly asking customer’s or vehicle’s information, this flow allows employees to have enough information to know who is in front of the door and what their order is. For users, this flow increases contactless with other people under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="images/sketch-2.png" alt="sketch-2">
                <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Similar to User Flow 1, User Flow 2 is designed for both personas mentioned above, and the flow increases contactless with other people under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health, by having enough information before giving the food instead of directly asking customers. Nevertheless, there are a few differences in the process. Instead of showing codes in User Flow 1, users can enter their information about themselves, including their appearance for picking up in person. While the process for “In Car” has the same UX flow, it is actually a little bit different about details in Sketches section.</p>

        <h2>Low Fidelity Prototypes and User Testing</h2>

        <h3>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h3>

        <div class="two-sketches">
            <div>
                <img src="images/lo-fi-1.png" alt="lo-fi-1">
                <h3>Prototype 1</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">For this prototype, it has two options to pick up, which are “In Person” and “Contactless” (or “In Car”). For “In Person”, it has a number on the app that helps employees recognize which food they should give to the particular customer. When customers arrive, they can show their numbers in front of the restaurant to let employees know. For “Contactless”, it has one dropdown option to choose for the type of vehicle (motorcycle, sedan, suv, truck, etc.), and one input field for license plate number. With that information of the vehicle, it helps employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to quickly give the food to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="images/lo-fi-2.png" alt="lo-fi-2">
                <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Similarly, Prototype 2 also has the same two options to pick up. However, there are a few differences in details of what information customers can provide to help employees. For “In Person”, it asks for the description of customers’ appearance, including “Gender/race”, “Shirt Color”, and “Pant Color”. Thus, employees can recognize different customers more easily with different details about each customer. For “In Car”, it asks for the “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”. Similar to Prototype 1, “In Car” option helps employees have an easier time to recognize which vehicle customers are in, in order to quickly give the food to them.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Lo-Fi User Testing</h3>

        <p>What users liked most about Prototype 1 was it was more simple in “In Person” option, since it only showed the number to confirm with the employees. While, what they liked most about Prototype 2 was they did not have to type license plate numbers, which many people did not remember them, and had to go out of the vehicle and check for the numbers.</p>

        <p>For Prototype 1, the only confusion was the confirmation number of the “In Person” option, since it was not descriptive enough in order to guide customers what to do with it. While, there was no struggling or confusion when they used Prototype 2.
        </p>

        <p>Overall, they preferred to use Prototype 1, since it was more simple to use, and had less details to fill out.</p>

        <p>For the “In Person” option, they preferred Prototype 1, because they did not like to fill out details about their appearance. Additionally, they mentioned that asking about “Gender/race” might be sensitive to many people, which may lead to uncomfortable situations.</p>

        <p>For the “In Car” option, they did not prefer either prototype. Nevertheless, one of the participants suggested having mix options from both prototypes for the “In Car” option including “Type of Vehicle”, “Make/Model”, and “Vehicle Color”.</p>

        <h2>High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ujm7mhW63ajoXMtyfYrAfR/Cogs-127-Project?node-id=89%3A407&viewport=-386%2C452%2C0.07577966898679733&scaling=scale-down">Click here if you are not able to access the prototype directly below</a>
        <p></p>

        <p>This high-fidelity prototype actually implements the mix of both of our original UX Flows in Milestone 3, since we got feedback from the users that they prefer some features of the first flow, while they also prefer some features of the second flow. Therefore, we did not have to change our flow technically, even though it took a bit to select the features from both flows to combine into one high fidelity prototype.</p>
        <p>Since our low fidelity prototypes are almost the same with our original UX flows, the process was the same, that we combined the features from both prototypes into one prototype. We learned that this was really good to have feedback from users, that we could learn more from different perspectives. We also realized that sometimes there were details that we did not recognize during our design process, and the users actually helped us a lot in spotting the details that we need to improve for our design.</p>
        <p>For our plans for next steps, we are going to have another testing on our high fidelity prototype, in order to have more feedback, especially on the visual aspects. Additionally, we are planning to reflect our process, so we can see if there are more aspects that we can improve, and have a more insightful case study.</p>

        <h2>Before-and-After Stories</h2>     
        <p>After feedback, we decided to use the alternative screen for “Vehicle Carryout”. For the original screen, when users typed information in “Make / Model / Brand”, the word “Make / Model / Brand” would disappear. If users forgot what information they needed to type in, they had to delete everything and started over again. Therefore, putting the word “Make / Model / Brand” above the text input field instead of putting it inside would help users be able to avoid that situation.</p>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>The project helped me know more about product design process. It helped me improve a lot my user research skills, including conduct user interviews, and user testing. Also, I learned to get better at collaborating with other people, as it has been a really important skill not only for Product Designers, but also in many other aspects. Additionally, we changed our plan a little bit when we were in progress, which we set a different goal for our project. It was a little bit challenging at first, but we eventually figured out what to do.</p>
