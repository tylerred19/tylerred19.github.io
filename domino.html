    <h1 class="domino-title">Domino's Pizza App Redesign</h1>

    <div class="ui-margin">
        <p>Note: The project is still in work progress. Thus, it is not completed yet, and there will be updates later.</p>
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
        <p>Time: September 2020 to Present</p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>UI/UX Designers: An Huynh, and Tam (Tyler) Tran (me)</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>We are planning to extend or redesign Domino’s Pizza app. For users, we are targeting people who prefer ordering to pick their pizza up. Our current goal is to have users spend less time on waiting to pick up their food, and reduce contacting with employees. Therefore, that would be safer and more convenient, especially during COVID-19. It is really important to keep people safe during the pandemic, and also help people feel more comfortable with using the app, that people do not have to worry about having to order in person, or through phone calls, which employees might be too busy and do not pick up the phone calls sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        <p>Our main research goal is to have a better understanding of users’ perspectives, especially everyone has a different point of view. As designers, we know that if we do not have proper user research, we might have our design plan with biased perspectives, that has happened a lot in many designs around the world. We chose interviews as a research method. The reason we chose this particular method was because we would like to talk in depth with users, and have open ended questions. Therefore, we would have more qualitative information, and there would be more to analyze. Also, our users would like to talk with us by calling through phones, or using Zoom. For our plan, we are going to interview about 5 to 7 people for our project. Additionally, the participants are relevant to our project because they often eat pizza, and would like to use an app to save their time, and be safer during the pandemic.</p>

        <h2>Research Findings (Need to adjust this later)</h2>
        <p>Most people we interviewed including domino’s employee said that customers have to wait longer than their ideal time in the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Even though they feel okay most of the time, they would like to have less waiting time. Moreover, some people might get irritated sometimes, if they are starving.</p>
        <p>The employee also pointed out that they sometimes don’t have enough space for cooked-pizzas (keep warm before pick-up) because of stacked orders. (Our new feature also solves this problem)</p>
        <p>Most participants are okay with directly talking to employees, because they wear their mask. However, they prefer to reduce contact with employees as much as possible in order to be safer.</p>
        <p>Additionally, a few participants mention that it would be great to reduce the time wearing a mask, since they are not comfortable with wearing it. Therefore, they prefer the “in car” option for picking up their food. With the “in car” option, they can stay in their car and do not have to wear a mask unless it is necessary. Also, they do not have to stand outside, especially if there are many other people also waiting for their food.</p>
        <h3>Note: We can check more information from Milestone 5</h3>

        <h2>Problem Statement (Need to reconsider)</h2>
        <p>People who prefer to pick up their pizzas usually have to wait longer than their ideal time, and they might get frustrated if they wait too long, or they are starving. Even though there is a feature to help customers notify employees that they have arrived, there are still uncomfortable experiences from both perspectives. The reason is there is no way to confirm customers’ identity early, and the only way to confirm is to directly ask them.</p>

        <h2>How Might We Statements (might reduce the amount of statements)</h2>
        <p>How might we help customers spend less time on waiting to save their time?</p>
        <p>How might we help customers reduce the time wearing masks?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees have an easier time noticing when customers come to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees reduce losing their customers because they have to wait for their pizza for a long time? (might adjust this later)</p>
        <p>How might we help employees recognize customers who have arrived and ready to pick up?</p>
        <p>How might we help employees not feel frustrated because there are too many customers tapping the “I’m Here” button at the same time?</p>

        <h2>Personas (Need to check the details of the personas)</h2>
        <div class="persona-two-columns">
            <div>
                <h2>Persona 1: Helen</h2>
                <p>A software engineer working remotely at home</p>
                <p>She wants to have her pizza quickly, so that she can pick up the pizza from the store that is close to her house. Also, she prefers carside carryout to reduce contact in the pandemic.</p>
                <p>Sometimes she has to wait for a bit too long, that she might get anxious when she still has a lot of tasks to do for her job.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Persona 2: Adam</h2>
                <p>An employee working at a pizza restaurant</p>
                <p>Adam does not want his customers to wait for a long line to carry out their pizza.</p>
                <p>However, many times customers have to wait in a long line, and they get frustrated. Especially when some people feel uncomfortable that they have to wear a mask.</p>
                <p>He also notices that many users use Domino’s new “ByPass” feature and click “I’m here” to confirm at the same time, which confuses employees.</p>

        <h2>Competitive Audit (Need to check the details of the explanation again)</h2>

        <table id="domino-table">
            <tr>

            <tr>

                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>For Domino’s Pizza mobile application, there is no feature that can recognize customers who are ready to pick up. Thus, this gives frustration to both customers and employees. Since there are many users tapping the new feature at the same time, employees have to spend more time to recognize the identity of users. Because of that, users have to wait for an extra time before picking up their pizza. Additionally, it might be safer if the time of interacting between customers and employees is reduced.</p>

        <h2>Note: check Milestone 3 for BOTH UX Flows and UI Sketches</h2>

        <h2>UX Flows (necessary? - might consider later)</h2>

        <h2>UI Sketches (Need to add explanation below the sketches)</h2>

        <div class="two-sketches">
            <div>
                <img src="images/sketch-1.png" alt="sketch-1">
                <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">User Flow 1 is designed for both Adam and Helen personas because it offers a new feature which helps customers to save more time and employees to identify customers easier. Instead of directly asking customer’s or vehicle’s information, this flow allows employees to have enough information to know who is in front of the door and what their order is. For users, this flow increases contactless with other people under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="images/sketch-2.png" alt="sketch-2">
                <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Similar to User Flow 1, User Flow 2 is designed for both personas mentioned above, and the flow increases contactless with other people under the pandemic which is very important for user’s health, by having enough information before giving the food instead of directly asking customers. Nevertheless, there are a few differences in the process. Instead of showing codes in User Flow 1, users can enter their information about themselves, including their appearance for picking up in person. While the process for “In Car” has the same UX flow, it is actually a little bit different about details in Sketches section.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>From UI sketching experience, we both learned how to organize and convert our ideas into sketches. Sketching gave us more solutions to solve our problems and was the best way to practice our teamwork. We were actually surprised that we came up with several alternatives for the details of the features we would like to have. Those sketches really helped us to connect between our competitive audit, and our problem statement.</p>
